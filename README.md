# Project Overview

This project focuses on building a binary classifier to predict the has_disease column using the dataset training_data.csv. The goal is to preprocess the data, train the model, evaluate its performance, and generate predictions for the test data, optimizing for the F1 score.

## Files

training_data.csv: Dataset used for training the model.
test_data.csv: Dataset used for generating predictions.
submission.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
answers.csv: Output file containing the predicted has_disease values for the test data.
Steps to Follow

1. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing data using appropriate imputation methods for categorical and numerical columns.
Standardize numerical features to improve model performance.
Encode categorical features as required for the model.
Handle outliers in the dataset.
Ensure all transformations (imputation, scaling) are based only on the training data to prevent data leakage.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore and visualize the dataset to understand feature distributions, correlations, and patterns.
Identify missing values and outliers.
Remove unnecessary columns if they do not contribute to the modelâ€™s performance.
3. Model Building
Train a binary classifier using Logistic Regression, SGDClassifier, or any suitable model from SciKit-Learn.
Experiment with cross-validation to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.
Aim to maximize the F1 score by tuning hyperparameters and optimizing the model.
Optionally, create new features (meta-features) that combine existing ones to improve performance.
4. Predictions and Evaluation
Apply the trained model to the test_data.csv to generate predictions.
Impute missing values in the test data using the transformers fitted on the training data.
Save the predictions to answers.csv, containing a single column has_disease with the predicted values.
Usage

Open the Notebook: Start by opening submission.ipynb in Jupyter.
Load the Data: Load training_data.csv for analysis and preprocessing.
Preprocess the Data: Handle missing values, outliers, standardize, and encode features as necessary.
Train the Model: Train and evaluate the model using cross-validation.
Generate Predictions: Use the trained model to predict values for test_data.csv and save them to answers.csv.
Notes

All code must be well-documented with comments and markdown to explain the steps and findings.
Focus on optimizing the F1 score by experimenting with different models, imputation methods, and feature engineering.
Output

The final predictions for test_data.csv will be saved in answers.csv, which contains a single column with the predicted has_disease values.
